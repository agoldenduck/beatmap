When the form has been validated, show an alert box that displays the data entered and asks the user if that data entered is correct. If yes, thank the visitor and submit the form. If no, prevent the form from submitting so users can go back and make adjustments where necessary. Ensure the form fields remain populated with data.

Notes:
Could not get this to work on IE8 or IE10 - I hope this is a local problem because the people of the internet seemed unsure why this wouldn't work for others who seemed to experience it. Specifically the confirm box would not appear, it would go immediately to the success page. Other validations all worked fine. I would love to know if you can see why this isn't working on IE.

Provide code for a Login feature. Once the user logs in successfully, every page of the site will display the user's login name, along with a link allowing them to logout at any time. You can achieve this by either utilising Ajax, or hardcoding a username and password into a basic JavaScript routine. You will need to use cookies to maintain a logged in state across all pages of the website.

Use javascript to disable the link in the current page. Make sure it is still obvious which page you are on. Currently it displays differently using css but is still clickable.
